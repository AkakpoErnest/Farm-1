# Supabase Authentication Setup - Farm Talk Ghana

## 🚀 Real Authentication Implementation

The Farm Talk Ghana app now uses **real Supabase authentication** instead of demo accounts. Users can create real accounts, sign up, and log in securely.

## 📋 What's Been Implemented

✅ **Real User Registration & Login**
- Email/password authentication
- User profile creation with role selection (farmer, expert, customer)
- Secure password storage in Supabase Auth

✅ **User Management**
- Profile updates
- Role-based access control
- Secure session management

✅ **Database Integration**
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Secure data access

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `zdvmefsqanakzmebxijs`
3. **Go to SQL Editor**
4. **Copy and paste** the contents of `supabase_setup.sql`
5. **Run the SQL script**

This will create:
- `users` table for user profiles
- `chat_messages` table for chat history
- `weather_data` table for weather information
- `market_prices` table for crop prices
- `subsidies` table for agricultural subsidies
- `experts` table for expert profiles

### 2. Authentication Settings

1. **Go to Authentication → Settings** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Enable Email Confirmations** (optional but recommended)
3. **Set Site URL** to: `http://localhost:8080`
4. **Add Redirect URLs**:
   - `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:8080/reset-password`

### 3. Test the Authentication

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Go to**: http://localhost:8080
3. **Click "Sign Up"** to create a new account
4. **Use real email and password**
5. **Select your role** (farmer, expert, or customer)

## 🔐 How It Works

### User Registration Flow
1. User fills out registration form
2. Supabase creates auth account
3. Database trigger creates user profile
4. User is automatically logged in

### User Login Flow
1. User enters email/password
2. Supabase validates credentials
3. User profile is fetched from database
4. User is authenticated and redirected

### Security Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Secure password hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **JWT tokens**: Secure session management
- **Automatic profile creation**: No orphaned auth accounts

## 📱 Available User Roles

- **Farmer**: Agricultural producers
- **Expert**: Agricultural consultants and advisors
- **Customer**: Buyers and consumers

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Accounts (No longer needed - use real signup!)
The app no longer uses demo accounts. Create real accounts by:

1. **Sign Up** with your email
2. **Choose a strong password**
3. **Select your role**
4. **Add optional phone and location**

### Sample Data
The database comes with sample:
- Weather data for major Ghanaian cities
- Market prices for common crops
- Agricultural subsidies and grants

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid login credentials"**
- Check if email is correct
- Ensure password meets requirements (min 6 characters)

**"User already registered"**
- Try logging in instead of signing up
- Use password reset if needed

**"Profile not found"**
- This should be automatic, but check database tables
- Ensure `supabase_setup.sql` was run completely

### Database Issues

If tables don't exist:
1. Check SQL Editor for errors
2. Ensure you're in the correct project
3. Verify RLS policies are created

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase project settings
3. Ensure all SQL was executed successfully

## 🎯 Next Steps

With real authentication working, you can now:
- Add more user profile fields
- Implement role-based features
- Add social login (Google, Facebook)
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add user verification features
